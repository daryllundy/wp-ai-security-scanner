## Executive Summary

The WordPress AI Security Scanner Plugin is an intelligent security analysis tool designed to proactively identify vulnerabilities, malicious code, and security misconfigurations within WordPress installations. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and pattern recognition, the plugin provides real-time threat detection, automated remediation suggestions, and comprehensive security reporting for WordPress site administrators.

## Problem Statement

- **Proactive threat detection** beyond traditional signature-based scanning
- **Intelligent analysis** of custom themes and plugins for security vulnerabilities  
- **Automated remediation guidance** for identified security issues
- **Real-time monitoring** with minimal performance impact
- **Accessible security insights** for non-technical users

## Solution Overview

WordPress AI Security Scanner combines traditional security scanning with artificial intelligence to provide:

1. **AI-Powered Code Analysis** - Machine learning models trained on malware patterns and vulnerability databases
2. **Real-Time File Integrity Monitoring** - Intelligent detection of unauthorized file modifications
3. **Behavioral Anomaly Detection** - AI analysis of user behavior patterns to identify suspicious activity
4. **Automated Vulnerability Assessment** - Smart scanning of themes, plugins, and core files
5. **Intelligent Reporting Dashboard** - User-friendly interface with actionable security insights
